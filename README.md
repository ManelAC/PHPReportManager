# PHPReportManager
A simple PHP web application to track the state of your client reports.

### How to use it?
I have used Bitnami WAMP 8.1.6-0 to develop this application, but all you need is a web server to execute the PHP files and a SQL database to store the information.

You will find the database structure in `db_structure/php_report_manager.sql` so you can import them into your own database.
